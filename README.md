#### How to Run

Visit [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_U_brwayFKBmD6pEcPf7Jpp7IfBt_Dip) to see all source files for this project. The primary ones to download are `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `train_clean.csv`. For the data cleaning notebooks, `glove.42B.300d.txt` is required (can be found in the `glove.42B.300d` folder), as well as `LSTM.h5`. All of these files can be added directly to this working folder, as paths are structured in this format: `./example.csv`.
